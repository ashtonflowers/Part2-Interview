# Interview time with Jeremy

## Overview
To give you a better idea of "real" GitHub workflows, I want you to fill out the below interview.  Many open source projects have their source repositories available publicly on GitHub.  They want to accept contributions from anyone, but they also have a few requirements:
1. They don't want to allow direct push access to their repository, because they want to choose whether or not to accept the patch (perhaps they need to require a license agreement, or they want to make sure all tests pass before taking the patch)
1. They want to be able to give feedback on the patch before accepting it (perhaps it violates coding standards, or is missing tests, etc.)

For git repositories with these types of requirements, GitHub has the [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) process. Pull requests let a third party propopse a patch to the repository, and let reviewers (either human or machine) provide feedback and request additional changes for the patch. 

There are multiple ways to make a pull request.  For open source development, adding everyone who wants to send a pull request as a collaborator to that repository is infeasible (even if there are fine-grained permissions to allow for "pull-request-proposer only").  So their pull request model more generally follows this pattern:
1. User Bob wants to contribute to project `next-best-thing` (which is publicly available on GitHub).  User Nancy is a "maintainer" of `next-best-thing`.  That means that Nancy has the rights to modify the repo (merging commits, rebasing, etc.).
1. Bob starts by [making a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of `next-best-thing`.  That means he has a copy of `next-best-thing` in his GitHub account, along with metadata that "remembers" that the original source of this repository was the authority `next-best-thing` maintained by Nancy.
1. Bob clones his `next-best-thing` repo to his local development environment (in your case this would be your Amazon workspace, cloning either through IntelliJ or the command line).
1. Bob makes his modifications on his local copy (either on the default `master` branch or on a branch specific for this change).
1. Bob [pushes his changes](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) to his fork of the repo.  At this point, Bob can log into GitHub and see his changes.  He is now prepared to create a pull request.
1. Bob [creates a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) that is sent _to the original repo_ that Nancy helps to maintain.  Note that this is different than what you will typically do.
1. Nancy reviews Bob's change, providing feedback.  Frequently, Bob will have to [update his pull request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9790448/how-to-update-a-pull-request-from-forked-repo) with more commits to address Nancy's concerns.
1. Finally, Nancy is happy with Bob's pull request and [merges](https://help.github.com/en/articles/merging-a-pull-request) it into the authoritative `next-best-thing` repository.  At this point she can decide whether she wants to keep Bob's full commit history, or "squash" it into a single commit.

## Getting Started:
For this lab, you should play the role of Bob in the Overview section above.  Fill out the Interview below, and send me a pull request when you're done!

For each question, please add your response to any other responses already recorded.  Your answer should be formatted similar to the following sample:

Q1: Is this a question?
* _Jeremy_: yes it is

Q2: What is the answer?
* _Jeremy_: Of course, the answer is [42](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(answer)).



## Submitting Your Work
Once I have merged your pull request into my repo, please submit your repo along with a screenshot of your pull request in Blackboard.
